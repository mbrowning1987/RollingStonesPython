# RollingStonesPython

Hey!!
My goal for this project originally was to figure out which decade within my dataset had the most albums in it. That turned into a few other questions. 
I also answered which genre had the most albums, as well as which artist within the dataset was on there the most. 

I used a bar graph for the genres, a pie chart for decades, and a bar graph for artist.
